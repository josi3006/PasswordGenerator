# PasswordGenerator
Homework #3, using Javascript to make a password generator


The function of the application is to generate a random password based on criteria the user selects, specifically, the number of characters
in the password, and the type(s) of characters (lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers and/or special characters).

The application works by presenting a form which asks the user to indicate their preferences for password length and character types.
Once the criteria are selected, Javascript functions run which...

1) generate an array of characters which meet the user's criteria,
2) generate a string of random characters from that array, with the string length equal to the user's preference,
3) append the string (the password) to the body of the page.

See below for screenshots of the application ("before" and "after" operation):
